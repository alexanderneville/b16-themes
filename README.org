#+TITLE: My Theme Collection

A small collection of my preferred 16 colour themes. These themes conform to the semantics of /base16/, a relatively informal community project to standardise the use of colours across related applications. More information can be found in the [[https://github.com/tinted-theming/home][tinted-theming/home]] and [[https://github.com/chriskempson/base16][chriskempson/base16]] documentation. A much larger selection of themes can be found in the [[https://github.com/tinted-theming/base16-schemes][tinted-theming/base16-schemes]] repository.

* Install

Included is a script to write the yaml formatted themes to /Xresources/ format and generate a set of shell scripts which can change the ANSI escape sequences of your shell, effective for all terminal emulators, inluding Linux TTY!
