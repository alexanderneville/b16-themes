#+TITLE: My Theme Collection

A small collection of my preferred 16 colour themes. These themes conform to the semantics of /base16/, a relatively informal community project to standardise the use of colours across related applications. More information can be found in the [[https://github.com/tinted-theming/home][tinted-theming/home]] and [[https://github.com/chriskempson/base16][chriskempson/base16]] documentation. A much larger selection of themes can be found in the [[https://github.com/tinted-theming/base16-schemes][tinted-theming/base16-schemes]] repository.

A theme in this format has 16 colors, split into 8 shades and 8 tones. The set of 8 colours is enough for syntax highlighting in most cases, without the need for bright colours. The remaining 8 colours can be used for user interface elements such as status lines, gutters and menus.

The order of the 16 colours in yaml is not the same as the order they appear in a 16 colour xterm pallete. One drawback of this approach is that the bright terminal colours are not displayed correctly and the semantics of the ISO 6429 are not upheld. I do not mind this behaviour, as it makes writing schemes for TUI applications such as vifm and tmux very easy.

* Examples

Here are some of my favourite schemes:

- Gruvbox Dark Hard:
[[./screenshots/gruv.png]]
- Gruvbox Material Dark Hard:
[[./screenshots/gruv_material.png]]
- Atom One Dark:
[[./screenshots/onedark.png]]
- VS**** dark:

* Install

Included is a script to write the yaml formatted themes to /Xresources/ format and generate a set of shell scripts which can change the ANSI escape sequences of your shell, effective for all terminal emulators, inluding Linux TTY!
