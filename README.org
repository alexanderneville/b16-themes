#+TITLE: My Theme Collection

A small collection of my preferred 16 colour themes. These themes conform to the semantics of /base16/, a relatively informal community project to standardise the use of colours across related applications. More information can be found in the [[https://github.com/chriskempson/base16][original]] and [[https://github.com/tinted-theming/home][community]] /base16/ documentation. A much larger selection of themes can be found in [[https://github.com/tinted-theming/base16-schemes][this]] repository.

A theme in this format has 16 colours, split into 8 shades and 8 colours. The set of 8 colours is enough for syntax highlighting in most cases, without the need for bright colours. The remaining 8 colours can be used to control the display of user interface elements such as status lines, gutters, line numbers and menus, which is much more useful.

* Examples

Here are some of my favourite schemes:

- Gruvbox Dark Hard:

- Gruvbox Material Dark Hard:

- Atom One Dark:

- VS**** dark:

* Install

Included is a script to write the yaml formatted themes to /Xresources/ format and generate a set of shell scripts which can change the ANSI escape sequences of your shell, effective for all terminal emulators, including Linux TTY!
